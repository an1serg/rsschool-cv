- **Ecommerce Store & Admin dashboard** <br>
  This project consists of two parts: <br>
  **[Admin dashboard](https://ecommerce-admin-jkd1zej1t-an1serg.vercel.app/)** <br>
  The admin dashboard allows users to manage the store efficiently. You can add new products, access store statistics, and track order statuses through this interface. <br>
  **[Store](https://ecommerce-store-tawny-tau.vercel.app/)**<br>
  On the other hand, the online store utilizes the data from the admin panel to display products, categories, and more, ensuring a seamless shopping experience for customers. <br>

- **[Airbnb Clone](https://an1serg-rent-app.vercel.app/)**<br>
  My project, an Airbnb clone, provides property owners with the capability to list their homes and apartments, while allowing users to easily search, book, and review accommodations. It incorporates user authentication, detailed property listings, and booking systems. With a responsive design and data security measures, this platform delivers a comprehensive and user-friendly experience for both hosts and guests.
